abstract = {Aspirin intake has been shown to lead to significant protection against colorectal cancer, for example with an up to twofold reduction in colorectal adenoma incidence rates at higher doses. The mechanisms contributing to protection are not yet fully understood. While aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug and can thus influence the tumor microenvironment, in vitro and in vivo experiments have recently shown that aspirin can also have a direct effect on cellular kinetics and fitness. It reduces the rate of tumor cell division and increases the rate of cell death. The question arises whether such changes in cellular fitness are sufficient to significantly contribute to the epidemiologically observed protection. To investigate this, we constructed a class of mathematical models of in vivo evolution of advanced adenomas, parameterized it with available estimates, and calculated population level incidence. Fitting the predictions to age incidence data revealed that only a model that included colonic crypt competition can account for the observed age-incidence curve. This model was then used to predict modified incidence patterns if cellular kinetics were altered as a result of aspirin treatment. We found that changes in cellular fitness that were within the experimentally observed ranges could reduce advanced adenoma incidence by a sufficient amount to account for age incidence data in aspirin-treated patient cohorts. While the mechanisms that contribute to the protective effect of aspirin are likely complex and multi-factorial, our study demonstrates that direct aspirin-induced changes of tumor cell fitness can significantly contribute to epidemiologically observed reduced incidence patterns.},

ABSTRACT = {Genome sequencing studies have characterized the genetic alterations of different tumor types, highlighting the diversity of the molecular processes driving tumor development. Comprehensive sequencing studies have defined molecular subtypes of colorectal cancers (CRCs) through the identification of genetic events associated with microsatellite stability (MSS), microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H), and hypermutation. Most of these studies characterized primary tumors. Only recent studies have addressed the characterization of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of metastatic CRC. Metastatic CRC genomes were found to be not fundamentally different from primary CRCs in terms of the mutational landscape or of genes that drive tumorigenesis, and a genomic heterogeneity associated with tumor location of primary tumors helps to define different clinical behaviors of metastatic CRCs. Although CRC metastatic spreading was traditionally seen as a late-occurring event, growing evidence suggests that this process can begin early during tumor development and the clonal architecture of these tumors is consistently influenced by cancer treatment. Although the survival rate of patients with metastatic CRC patients improved in the last years, the response to current treatments and prognosis of many of these patients remain still poor, indicating the need to discover new improvements for therapeutic vulnerabilities and to formulate a rational prospective of personalized therapies.},

    abstract = { The questions of how healthy colonic crypts maintain their size, and how homeostasis is disrupted by driver mutations, are central to understanding colorectal tumorigenesis. We propose a three-type stochastic branching process, which accounts for stem, transit-amplifying (TA) and fully differentiated (FD) cells, to model the dynamics of cell populations residing in colonic crypts. Our model is simple in its formulation, allowing us to estimate all but one of the model parameters from the literature. Fitting the single remaining parameter, we find that model results agree well with data from healthy human colonic crypts, capturing the considerable variance in population sizes observed experimentally. Importantly, our model predicts a steady-state population in healthy colonic crypts for relevant parameter values. We show that APC and KRAS mutations, the most significant early alterations leading to colorectal cancer, result in increased steady-state populations in mutated crypts, in agreement with experimental results. Finally, our model predicts a simple condition for unbounded growth of cells in a crypt, corresponding to colorectal malignancy. This is predicted to occur when the division rate of TA cells exceeds their differentiation rate, with implications for therapeutic cancer prevention strategies. }

    abstract = {Considerable evidence supports the effectiveness of aspirin for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) in addition to its well-established benefits in the prevention of vascular disease. Epidemiologic studies have consistently observed an inverse association between aspirin use and risk of CRC. A recent pooled analysis of a long-term posttrial follow-up of nearly 14,000 patients from four randomized, cardiovascular disease prevention trials showed that daily aspirin treatment for about five years was associated with a 34\% reduction in 20-year CRC mortality. A separate metaanalysis of nearly 3,000 patients with a history of colorectal adenoma or cancer in four randomized adenoma prevention trials showed that aspirin reduced the occurrence of advanced adenomas by 28\% and any adenoma by 17\%. Aspirin has also been shown to be beneficial in a clinical trial of patients with Lynch syndrome, a hereditary CRC syndrome; in those treated with aspirin for at least two years, there was a 50\% or more reduction in the risk of CRC commencing five years after randomization and after aspirin had been discontinued. A few observational studies have shown an increase in survival among patients with CRC who use aspirin. Taken together, these findings strengthen the case for consideration of long-term aspirin use in CRC prevention. Despite these compelling data, there is a lack of consensus about the balance of risks and benefits associated with long-term aspirin use, particularly in low-risk populations. The optimal dose to use for cancer prevention and the precise mechanism underlying aspirin's anticancer effect require further investigation. Cancer Prev Res; 5(2); 164–78. ©2011 AACR.},

abstract = {Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2020) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2021). In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6\%–1\% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2\%–3\% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus-associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1\%–2\% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late-1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two-fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.},

abstract = {Cancer evolution cannot be observed directly in patients, and new methodologies are needed for obtaining a quantitative understanding of this obscure process. We develop and analyze a stochastic model of malignant transformation in the colon that precisely quantifies the process of colorectal carcinogenesis in patients through loss of tumor suppressors APC and TP53 and gain of the KRAS oncogene. Our study employs experimentally measured mutation rates in the colon and growth advantages provided by driver mutations. We calculate the probability of a colorectal malignancy, the sizes of premalignant lesions, and the order of acquisition of driver mutations during colorectal tumor evolution. Our model can be used as a starting point in evaluating early detection and treatment efforts. Quantifying evolutionary dynamics of cancer initiation and progression can provide insights into more effective strategies of early detection and treatment. Here we develop a mathematical model of colorectal cancer initiation through inactivation of two tumor suppressor genes and activation of one oncogene, accounting for the well-known path to colorectal cancer through loss of tumor suppressors APC and TP53 and gain of the KRAS oncogene. In the model, we allow mutations to occur in any order, leading to a complex network of premalignant mutational genotypes on the way to colorectal cancer. We parameterize the model using experimentally measured parameter values, many of them only recently available, and compare its predictions to epidemiological data on colorectal cancer incidence. We find that the reported lifetime risk of colorectal cancer can be recovered using a mathematical model of colorectal cancer initiation together with experimentally measured mutation rates in colorectal tissues and proliferation rates of premalignant lesions. We demonstrate that the order of driver events in colorectal cancer is determined primarily by the fitness effects that they provide, rather than their mutation rates. Our results imply that there may not be significant immune suppression of untreated benign and malignant colorectal lesions.}}

abstract = "Genetic instability is a defining feature of human cancer. In colorectal cancer, two specific types of genetic instabilities have been identified: microsatellite instability (MIN) leads to a 1000-fold increase in the rate of subtle DNA changes, whereas chromosomal instability (CIN) enhances the rate at which gross chromosomal changes occur during cell division. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of colon cancer initiation. We outline the processes and rate constants that determine the fraction of colon cancers where MIN or CIN mutations precede the inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. For a wide range of parameter values, we find support for the radical hypothesis that genetic instability initiates colonic tumorigenesis. We compare sporadic and hereditary forms of colorectal cancer.",

abstract = {A set of differential equations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stability matrix of a dynamical system, as well as for the Lyapunov exponents and the corresponding eigenvectors, is derived. The rate of convergence of the Lyapunov eigenvectors is shown to be exponential. The eigenvectors of the stability matrix can be grouped into sets, each spanning a subspace which converges at an exponential rate. It is demonstrated that, generically, the real parts of the eigenvalues of the stability matrix equal the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. This statement has been tested numerically. The values of the Lyapunov exponents, μi, are shown to be related to the corresponding finite time values of the Lyapunov exponents (e.g. those deduced from a finite time numerical simulation), μi(t), by: μi(t) = μi + (bi + ξi(t))/t. The bi's are constants and ξi(t) are “noise” terms of zero mean. This observation leads to a method of extrapolation, which has been used to predict Lyapunov exponents from a finite amount of data. It is shown that the use of the standard (numerical) methods to compute Lyapunov exponents introduces an error ai/t in the value of μi(t), where the ai's are constants. Thus the standard method has a rate of convergence which is the same as that of the exact μi(t)'s. Finally, we have shown how one can compute the eigenvectors associated with each of the eigenvalues of the stability matrix as well as the Lyapunov eigenvectors.}
